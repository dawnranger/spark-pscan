## Usage

```
val graph:Graph[Int, Int] = GraphLoader.edgeListFile(sc, "path_to_graph_file")

val components:Graph[VertexId, Int] = PSCAN.pscan(graph, epsilon = 0.2)

println("num communities: " + components.vertices.map{case (vId,cId)=>cId}.distinct.count)
println("nodes of every communities:")
components.vertices.map(v=>(v._2, v._1)).groupByKey().collect
    .foreach(x=>println("%d: %s".format(x._1, x._2.mkString(" "))))
```

##Ackowledgement

This repo is a re-organization of the PSCAN implementation in [this repo](sparkling-graph) with some minor change in order to make it more readable.
